## Security Notes

- Sessions are stored in HTTP-only cookies using JWT
- Authentication tokens are never exposed to the client
- All API routes require valid authentication
- Session secret should be a strong, random string in production

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure your client identifier is unique
- Check that the auth popup isn't blocked by your browser
- Verify your Plex account has access to a server

### Export Problems
- Make sure items are selected before exporting
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify your server is accessible

### Connection Issues
- Ensure your Plex server is running and accessible
- Check firewall settings if running locally
- Verify network connectivity to Plex services
